# NLP Module Project

## Description

This is the project for module 3 and is separated into three sections;
the first one is SentimentAnalysis and its objective is to analyze through a model 
(Vader in this case) the sentiment of a user in a text. 

The second one is NER where we have to set up a trainer to further train, 
and the last one is TransModels (traslation models)
where we compare the results (bleu) of two different models.


### Installing

Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 17 December last, and I wish you all a pleasant vacation.
As you have all been able to see, the great "Y2K bug" has not occurred. Instead, the citizens of several of our countries have been victims of truly terrible natural disasters.
Your Lordships have requested a debate on the subject in the next few days during this session.
Pending this, in agreement with many colleagues who have asked me to do so, I ask that we observe a minute's silence in memory of all the victims of the storms in the various countries of the European Union affected.
I invite all of us to stand for a minute of silence.
(Parliament stood for a minute's silence)
Madam President, a procedural matter.
You will know from the press and television that there have been a series of explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.
One of the people recently killed in Sri Lanka was Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam, who a few months ago visited the European Parliament.
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the President of Sri Lanka expressing Parliament‚§?s condolences for that and other violent deaths, asking him to do everything possible to find a peaceful reconciliation to the extremely difficult situation in his country?
Yes, Mr. Evans, I think that an initiative such as the one you have just suggested would be very appropriate.
If the Assembly agrees, I will do what Mr. Evans has just suggested.
Madam President, a procedural matter.
I would like your advice on Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.
My question concerns a matter that will be discussed on Thursday, when I will raise it again.
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programs comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 for a form of quota-based penalties to be applied to countries that do not meet their annual fleet reduction targets.
The report stipulates that it should be applied notwithstanding the principle of relative stability.
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of Community fisheries policies, so a proposal that subverts it is legally inadmissible.
I want to know whether this kind of objection can be made to what is only a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether it is something I can raise on Thursday.
Your Honor, if you wish, you can raise this issue at that time, that is, on Thursday before the report is presented.
Madam President, coinciding with this year's first part-session of the European Parliament, unfortunately, in the United States, in Texas, the execution of a condemned man, a young man of 34 years of age whom we shall call Hicks, has been scheduled for next Thursday.
At the request of a French Member of Parliament, Mr. Zimeray, a petition has been submitted, many of whose signatories have signed, including myself, but, in accordance with the position constantly expressed by the European Parliament and by the entire European Community, I ask you to intervene with the prestige of your office and of the institution you represent with the President and the Governor of the State of Texas, Mr. Bush, who has the power to suspend the death sentence and to pardon the condemned man.
All of this is in accordance with the principles that we have always supported.
Thank you, Mr. Segni, I will do that very willingly.
It is certainly in line with the positions that our Parliament has always adopted.
Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that has been dealt with again and again in this Parliament.
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.
We all welcome the fact that the court has acquitted him and has shown that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.
However, it so happens that he will be charged again, as the prosecutor will appeal.
We know and we have actually stated in many resolutions - precisely at the last plenary session last year - that this is not only a legal case and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal conduct and treason because we, as those affected by his results, profit from it.
These results form the basis of the European Barents Sea programs and, therefore, I ask you to study a draft letter describing the most relevant facts to you and to make this position clear to Russia, which is in accordance with the decisions of the Parliament.
Yes, Mrs. Schroedter, I will gladly examine the facts related to this issue as soon as I receive your letter.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate you on having fulfilled your promise, as indeed in this first session of the new year the number of channels in our offices has been drastically increased.
However, Madam President, what I had asked for has not been done.
It is true that there are now two Finnish and one Portuguese channel, but there are still no Dutch channels, and I had asked you for a Dutch channel, because we Dutch would also like to hear the news every month when we are sent into exile.
Therefore I would like to ask you again to see to it that we can also watch a Dutch channel.
Mrs. Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this question is on the agenda of the quaestors meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
I hope it will be discussed in a positive spirit.
Madam President, could you tell me why this Parliament is not complying with the health and safety legislation that it has actually passed?
Why has no air quality testing of this building been done since we have been elected?
Why has no meeting of the Health and Safety Committee been held since 1998?
Why have we had no fire drills in either the Brussels or Strasbourg Parliament buildings?
Why are there no fire instructions?
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?
Why are the non-smoking areas not respected?
It is absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not even enforce it ourselves.
Mrs. Lynne, you are absolutely right, and I will check to see if these things have really not been done.
I will also submit the problem to the Board of Quaestors, and I am sure that the Quaestors will make sure that we respect the rules that we, in fact, voted for ourselves.
Madam President, Mrs. D√ez Gonz√°lez and myself had submitted questions on certain opinions, reproduced in a Spanish newspaper, of the Vice-President, Mrs. de Palacio.
The competent services have not included them in the agenda because they considered that they had already been answered in a previous session.
I ask that this decision be reconsidered because this is not the case.
The previously answered questions referred to the intervention, in a certain file, of Mrs. de Palacio, not to those statements that appeared in the ABC newspaper last November 18.
Your Honor, we are going to verify all this.
I confess that, for the moment, things seem to me to be somewhat confusing.
Therefore, we are going to review them seriously so that everything is in order.
Madam President, I would like to know whether Parliament will issue a clear statement this week on the dissatisfaction with today‚§?s decision not to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority of this Parliament supported the arms embargo on Indonesia in the past.
Today‚§?s decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation in that country.
Therefore, Parliament must send a message, as this is the wish of the overwhelming majority.
It is irresponsible for EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.
As people have said, the situation there is extremely precarious.
In fact, there is a risk of a military coup in the future.
We do not know what is happening there.
Why should EU arms producers benefit at the expense of innocent people?
In any case, this topic does not figure right now among the urgent demands for next Thursday.
Order of business
The next item is the final draft agenda, drawn up in accordance with Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure, for the Conference of Presidents on Thursday 13 January.
As far as Monday and Tuesday are concerned, there are no changes.
Wednesday :
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests the inclusion of a statement by the Commission on its strategic objectives for the next five years, as well as on the administrative reform of the Commission.
I would like Mr. Bar√≥n Crespo, the author of the petition, to speak to justify it, if he thinks it is appropriate, of course.
As always, we will hear one speaker in favor and one speaker against.
Madam President, the presentation of the political programme of the Prodi Commission for the whole legislature was initially a proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists which achieved unanimity at the Conference of Presidents in September and also the explicit acceptance of President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his investiture speech.
This commitment is important insofar as the Commission is a body which has the monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically shapes what will be the political and legislative activity of this Parliament over the next five years.
I would also like to remind you, Madam President, that this Parliament voted its confidence in President Prodi on two occasions during the previous legislature; during this legislature it voted again in July and then, with the new Commission in office, it voted again in September to give a vote of confidence to the whole Commission.
Therefore, there has already been enough time for the Commission to prepare its program and for us to be able to know it and explain it to the citizens.
In this sense, I recall the resolution of September 15, in which it was recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
The events of the past week - which have taken place outside the Conference of Presidents, using it only to corroborate and ratify decisions taken outside it - pose a dilemma: either the Commission is not in a position to present this program (in which case it would be advisable for it to clarify it) or it is not in a position to present it (in which case it would be advisable for it to clarify it).
In the words of its Chairman, it is in a position to do so.
Given that the Commission is represented by the Vice-President, Mrs. de Palacio, I believe that before voting it would be advisable to know the Commission's situation in relation to its readiness to present the program, as agreed); or else Parliament is not in a position to examine this program, as some people seem to claim.
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would mean abandoning our responsibilities as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method consisting of informing the political groups in writing of the programmatic speech of the Commission a week before - and not the day before, as had been agreed, bearing in mind that the legislative program will be discussed in February, so that we could dispense with the debate, because the next day the press and the Internet would have made it known to all citizens and Parliament would no longer have to deal with the matter.
As my group believes that a Parliament is made to listen, to debate and to reflect, we believe that there is no reason to justify this postponement and we believe that if the Commission is in a position to do so, we are perfectly in time to be able to restore the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and to proceed responsibly before our fellow citizens.
Therefore, the proposal made by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and mentioned by the honourable Member is that on Wednesday the presentation of the Prodi Commission's legislative programme should be maintained, including the administrative reform project within this programme because, otherwise, we may find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: with the excuse that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission is denied the right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, a debate on the reform is denied without this Parliament having prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.
I would therefore ask you, Madam President, to ask the Commission to express its opinion at this time and then to proceed to the vote.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
. Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has the utmost respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, among them, that of establishing its agenda.
Therefore, we respect what Parliament may decide in this regard.
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to Parliament to incorporate a new debate, as Mr. Bar√≥n reminded us, which is in addition to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative program, on the main lines of action for the next five-year period, that is, for this legislature.
I would like to say, Madam President, that this debate was distinguished, in the agreement reached in September, from the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative program.
And I would like to say, Madam President, that, on the part of the Commission, we are ready and willing to hold this debate when it is convenient, that we were prepared to hold it this week, as agreed in principle, on the basis that it was presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups.
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to reiterate that, on our part, we have discussed the action program for the next five years and that we are prepared, when Parliament so decides -this very week if that is the decision- to come to present the program for the next five years and, next month, the program for the year 2000, which was perfectly agreed.
I propose that we vote on the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to reinstate the Commission's statement on its strategic objectives.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
On the subject of Wednesday, I have another proposal concerning the oral question on the capital tax.
The PPE-DE Group requests that this item be withdrawn from the agenda.
Will a colleague take the floor on behalf of the group to justify this request?
Madam President, I hear some laughter among the Socialists.
I have been told that there are also broad circles in the Socialist Group who welcome the deletion of this item from the agenda, since the vote in the Conference of Presidents did not include the vote of the relevant working group of our colleagues in the Socialist Group.
I do not know whether this information is correct, but we as the EPP/ED Group would in any case be grateful if this item could be deleted, as Parliament has already dealt with this issue many times.
There are also agreements against such a tax.

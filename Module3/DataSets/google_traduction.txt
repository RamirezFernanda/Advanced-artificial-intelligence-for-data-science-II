Resumption of the session period I declare resumed the session period of the European Parliament, interrupted last Friday, December 17, and I reiterate to Your Honors my wish that you have had a good holiday. As everyone has been able to verify, the great &quot;Year 2000 effect&quot; has not occurred. Instead, the citizens of several of our countries have been victims of truly terrible natural disasters. Your Honors have requested a debate on the subject for the next few days, during this period of sessions. Waiting for it to happen, in accordance with many colleagues who have asked me to, I ask that we observe a minute of silence in memory of all the victims of the storms, in the different countries of the European Union affected. I invite everyone to stand for a minute of silence. (Parliament, standing, observes a minute of silence) Madam President, a matter of procedure. You will know from the press and television that there have been a series of explosions and murders in Sri Lanka. One of the people recently assassinated in Sri Lanka was Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam, who visited the European Parliament a few months ago. Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the President of Sri Lanka expressing Parliament&#39;s condolences for this and other violent deaths, asking him to do everything possible to find a peaceful reconciliation in the extremely difficult situation What is your country experiencing? Yes, Mr. Evans, I think that an initiative such as the one you have just suggested would be very appropriate. If the Assembly agrees, I will do what Mr. Evans has just suggested. Madam President, a matter of procedure. I would like your advice on Article 143 concerning inadmissibility. My question refers to an issue that will be discussed on Thursday, the day I will raise it again. The Cunha report on multiannual steering programs is presented to Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 around a quota-based form of penalties to be applied to countries that fail to meet their annual fleet reduction targets. The report stipulates that it should be applied notwithstanding the principle of relative stability. I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of Community fisheries policies, so a proposal that subverts it is legally inadmissible. I want to know if this type of objection can be made to what is only a report, not a legislative proposal, and if it is something that I can raise on Thursday. Your Honor, if you wish, you can raise this issue at that time, that is, on the Thursday before the report is due. Madam President, coinciding with this year&#39;s first part-session of the European Parliament, unfortunately, in the United States, in Texas, the execution of a death row inmate, a 34-year-old young man we&#39;ll call Hicks. At the request of a French deputy, Mr Zimeray, a request has been presented, whose signatories have been numerous and among whom I count myself, however, in accordance with the position constantly expressed by the European Parliament and by the entire European Community, I ask you to intervene with the prestige of your position and of the Institution you represent before the President and Governor of the State of Texas, Mr. Bush, who has the power to suspend the death sentence and to pardon the convicted person. All this, in accordance with the principles that we have always supported. Thank you, Mr. Segni, I will gladly do so. It is, without a doubt, in line with the positions that our Parliament has always adopted. Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that this Parliament has dealt with time and time again. This is the case of Alexander Nikitin. We all celebrate here that the court has found him innocent and has shown that in Russia, too, access to information on the environment is a constitutional right. However, it happens that he is going to be charged again, as the prosecutor will file an appeal. We know and we have actually stated in many resolutions - precisely in the last plenary session of last year - that this is not just a legal case and that it is a mistake to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal conduct and treason, because we , as affected by its results, let us take advantage of it. These results constitute the basis of the European programs for the Barent Sea and, for this reason, I ask you to study a draft letter that describes the most relevant facts and that makes Russia aware of this position, which is in accordance with the decisions of the Parliament. Yes, Mrs. Schroedter, I will gladly review the facts on this subject as soon as I receive your letter. Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on having fulfilled your promise, since in this first session of the new year the number of channels in our offices has been drastically increased. However, Madam President, what I had asked for has not been done. It is true that there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese channel, but there are still none in the Netherlands and I had asked for a Dutch channel, because we Dutch people would also like to hear the news every month, when we send to this exile. Therefore I would like to ask you again to see that we can also watch a Dutch channel. Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this issue is on the agenda for the Quaestors&#39; meeting scheduled for Wednesday. I hope it will be reviewed in a positive spirit. Madam President, could you please tell me why this Parliament is not complying with the health and safety legislation that it has actually passed? Why hasn&#39;t this building been tested for air quality since we&#39;ve been elected? Why hasn&#39;t there been a meeting of the Health and Safety Committee since 1998? Why have we not had fire drills in either the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings? Why are there no instructions in case of fire? Why haven&#39;t the stairs been upgraded since my accident? Why are non-smoking areas not respected? It is totally shameful that we pass legislation and do not comply with it ourselves. Mrs. Lynne, you&#39;re absolutely right, and I&#39;ll check to see if these things haven&#39;t really been done. I will also take the problem to the College of Quaestors, and I am sure that the Quaestors will do what they can to ensure that we respect the rules that we actually voted for ourselves. Madam President, Mrs. DÃez GonzÃ¡lez and myself had submitted some questions about certain opinions, reproduced in a Spanish newspaper, of the Vice President, Mrs. de Palacio. The competent services have not included them in the agenda as they consider that they had already been answered in a previous session. I beg you to reconsider this decision because this is not the case. The questions answered previously referred to the intervention, in a certain file, of Mrs. de Palacio, not to those statements that appeared in the ABC newspaper on November 18 last. Your Honor, we are going to verify all this. I confess that, at the moment, things seem a bit confusing to me. Therefore, we are going to review them seriously so that everything is in order. Madam President, I would like to know if Parliament will issue a clear statement this week on the dissatisfaction with today&#39;s decision not to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority of this Parliament supported the embargo in the past of arms to Indonesia. Today&#39;s decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation in that country. Therefore, Parliament must send a message, since that is the desire of the vast majority. It is irresponsible of the EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo. As people have said, the situation there is extremely precarious. In fact, there is a risk of a military coup in the future. We do not know what is happening there. Why should EU arms producers benefit at the expense of innocent people? In any case, this issue is not currently among the urgent demands for next Thursday. Order of business In accordance with the order of business, the final draft of the order of business, established in accordance with article 110 of the Rules of Procedure, will be examined at the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, January 13. Regarding Monday and Tuesday, there are no changes. Wednesday : The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a statement from the Commission be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years, as well as on the administrative reform of the Commission. I would like Mr. Barón Crespo, author of the petition, to intervene to justify it, if he thinks it is appropriate, of course. As always, we will hear one speaker for and one speaker against. Madam President, the presentation of the political program of the Prodi Commission for the entire legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists that achieved unanimity at the Conference of Presidents in September and also the explicit acceptance of the President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his investiture speech. This commitment is important insofar as the Commission is a body that has a monopoly on the initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically configures what is going to be the political and legislative activity of this Parliament in the next five years. I also remember, Madam President, that this Parliament voted on two occasions in the previous legislature its confidence in President Prodi; in this legislature he voted for it again in July and later, with the new Commission in office, he returned in September to give the entire Commission a vote of confidence. Therefore, there has already been enough time for the Commission to prepare its program and for us to be able to learn about it and explain it to the citizens. In this sense, I remember the resolution of September 15, in which it was recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible. The events that occurred last week - which originated on the fringes of the Conference of Presidents and used it only to corroborate and ratify decisions taken outside of it - pose a dilemma: either the Commission is not in a position to present that program (In that case, it would be a good idea to clarify it. In the words of its Chairman, it is in a position to do so. Given that the Commission is represented by the Vice-Chairman, Mrs. de Palacio, I think that before voting it would be convenient to know the situation of the Commission in relation to his availability to present the program, as agreed); or Parliament is not in a position to examine this programme, as some seem to claim. In my opinion, this second hypothesis would mean abandoning our responsibilities as a Parliament, in addition to introducing an original thesis, an unknown method consisting of making known to the political groups in writing the programmatic speech of the Commission once week before -and not the day before, as had been agreed-, bearing in mind that the legislative program will be discussed in February, in such a way that we could dispense with the debate, because the next day the press and the Internet would have made it known to all citizens and Parliament would no longer have to deal with the matter. As my group believes that a Parliament is made to listen, to debate and to reflect, we believe that there is no reason to justify this postponement and we believe that if the Commission is in a position to do so, we are perfectly in time to be able to restore the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and to act responsibly towards our fellow citizens. Therefore, the proposal made by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and that the Honorable Member has mentioned is that on Wednesday the presentation of the legislative program of the Prodi Commission be maintained, including within this program also n the administrative reform project because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: with the excuse that there is no text, on the one hand, the right of the President of the Commission to speak in this Parliament is denied, and, on the other, secondly, that a debate on the reform takes place without this Parliament having prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based. Therefore, I ask you, Madam President, to ask the Commission to speak at this time and then to proceed to the vote. (Applause from the PSE group) . Madam President, I want to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has the utmost respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, among them, that of establishing its agenda. Therefore, we respect what Parliament may decide in this regard. But I also want to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to Parliament to incorporate a new debate, as Mr Barón recalled, which is added to the annual debate on the Commission&#39;s legislative programme, on the major lines of action for the next five-year period, that is, for this legislature. I would like to say, Madam President, that this debate differed, in the agreement reached in September, from the annual presentation of the Commission&#39;s legislative programme. And I would like to say, Madam President, that, as part of the Commission, we are prepared and willing to have that debate when appropriate, that we were prepared to develop it this week, as had been agreed in principle, starting from the basis of which was presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups. Therefore, Madam President, I would like to reiterate that, for our part, we have discussed the action program for the next five years and that we are prepared to, when Parliament so decides - this very week if he That is the decision - to come and present the program for the next five years and, next month, the program for the year 2000, which was what was perfectly agreed upon. I propose that we vote on the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to re-include the Commission&#39;s statement on its strategic objectives. (Parliament rejects the request) President. On the topic of Wednesday, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax. The PPE-DE group requests that this item be withdrawn from the agenda. Will a colleague take the floor on behalf of the group to justify this request? Madam President, I hear some laughter among the Socialists. I have been told that wide circles of the Socialist Group also welcome the deletion of this item from the agenda, since in the vote held at the Conference of Presidents the vote of the competent working group of our colleagues was missing of the Socialist Group. I do not know if this information is correct, but we as the PPE/DE Group would in any case appreciate this point being deleted, as Parliament has dealt with this issue many times already. There are also agreements against such a tax.
